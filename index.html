			<h3>What are Gnocchi?</h3>

				<p>Potato Gnocchi are a Northern Italian dish that are described as both a dumpling and a pasta. The gnocchi that are often found premade or even served in some Italian restaurants, are true bastardizations of what is to many, the best meal in the world. Unlike the dense rocks you would find in stores or restaurants, a true homemade gnocchi should be light, a little fluffy, and melt in your mouth. This simple recipe will explain how to make your own homemade gnocchi that is sure to make you question everything you thought you knew about how delicious pasta could be.

			<h3>Ingredients</h3>

				<li>5 Pound Idaho Potatoes</li>
				<li>2 Eggs</li>
				<li>Flour, Few Cups</li>
				<li>Salt, Few Tablespoons</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Forming The Dough</h3>
		
				<p>Begin by baking the potatoes at 450 degrees for 1 hour. While potatoes bake set up a large cutting board with a layer flour. This will be you station for preparing the dough and shaping the pasta. Soon after the Potatoes finish baking peel them (they should still be hot so be careful of burns) and put each potato through a potato ricer, letting the riced potatoes fall right onto your floured cutting board. Salt the potatoes with a few tablespoons of salt or to taste. let the potatoes cool. We are going to add the egg next and we don’t want the heat of the potato to cook the egg at all. 
				</p>

				<p>After the potatoes have cooled form two shallow wells to crack the eggs into. Now begin folding the potato and egg together with your hands adding flour a few handfuls at a time to form a dough and keep it from sticking. It is important that you add enough flour that the dough is no longer sticky but once you hit that point don’t add anymore. The more flour that is added the denser the gnocchi will be, and there is nothing worse than a dense gnoccho.

		<h3>Shaping and Cooking</h3>

			<p>With a dough scraper cut off baseball sized pieces of your dough that you will roll out into a long strand about the thickness of you thumb. Then cut the strand into inch long pieces and your raw gnocchi are ready to cook. Boil the gnocchi in salted water until they rise to the surface, then serve with your favorite tomato sauce or simply with butter and cheese.
